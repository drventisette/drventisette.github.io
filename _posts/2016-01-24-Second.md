Because Jekyll grabs the first paragraph you will not need to wrap the excerpt in p tags, which is already done for you. These tags can be removed with the following if youâ€™d prefer:

###Source Ordering

Using these source ordering classes, you can shift columns around between our breakpoints. This means if you place sub-navigation below main content on small displays, you have the option to position the sub-navigation on either the left or right of the page for large displays. Prefix push/pull with the size of the device you want to apply the styles to. .medium-push-#, .large-push-# is the syntax you'll use. Use large-reset-order to reset pushed or pulled columns to their original position on large screens.
